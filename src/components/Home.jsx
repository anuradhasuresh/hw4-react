        Welcome! This is the home page of my website. This website documents
        three of the places that I went to during my trip to Chicago over the
        long weekend, i.e. Navy Pier, Lincoln Park Zoo and 360 Chicago. I might
        add in a few more places from my trip later on, but for now these are
        the only three. I went to Chicago over the long Labour Day weekend,
        and this was my first time seeing a large city after coming to the US.
        It was a wonderful experience, and if I'm being honest, this was the
        first time when I felt like I was actually in the United States, because
        Fort Wayne is a small city, and Chicago is such a large place! Exploring
        downtown was such an unique experience, and we got to see so many
        different architectural styles.
