          In Chicago, Navy Pier is the place to go for events, free public
          programs, attractions, culture, food, shopping, and more. It's a place
          where you can have a good time whether you're visiting or a resident,
          with family or friends. There are so many restaurants, cafes, and most
          importantly, rides! There are quite a few rides that you can go on,
          like the Ferris Wheel, the carousel ride, etc. We went to Navy Pier on
          Saturday, and the main focus of our visit was the Chicago River
          Architectural Tour. We wanted to check the rides out too, but sadly
          ran out of time. This cruise is a 75 minute long cruise ride on the
          Chicago River, with a guide showing and talking about the history
          behind each architectural style used in the skyscrapers and buildings
          in Chicago. Our ride started at 6:45 pm, which is the perfect time to
          go in my opinion, because this window gives you the opportunity to see
          Chicago before and after sunset. You also get to see buildings shown
          in famous movies and shows, for example, the Chicago Board of Trade
          building from Batman. After the sun sets, the buildings are lit up
          with lights, which is a beautiful sight to see. I would highly
          recommend checking this tour out the next time you're in Chicago if
          you haven't already!
