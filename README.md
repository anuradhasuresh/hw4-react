    <h3>Your Website Description</h3>
    This assignment provides opportunities to use ReactJS in a creative environment. The end product is a
    dynamic website with modern styling and interesting event handling.
    <h2>Website Requirements</h2>
    <p>In HW3 you added vanilla JavaScript to your website to perform dynamic events and/or process data. Now your
        objective
        is to <strong>recreate your website using the ReactJS library</strong>! You may recreate the entire site or
        enough of the site to satisfy the requirements below.</p>
    <p>You are free to add additional front-end content to make your site more complete. If you wish to choose a
        different topic than you submitted for HW3, you must create a new application for that topic.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Use features of React</strong> to meet the following content requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>At least 4 Functional Components</li>
        <li>useState and/or useEffect Hook to Manage State</li>
        <li>Passing Data via props or Context</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may use any additional features of React that helps to implement your website.
    </p>

        <li>Array/object destructuring</li>
        <li>Built-in Array methods</li>
        <li>Local or Session storage for simple client-side data</li>
        <li>async/await to Promise</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Use <strong>appropriate Git practice</strong> to complete the homework. Create a branch to work on each page,
